These lines would then be clustered together into a forme to transfer ink onto a page. A typesetter needed an eye for proportion, excellent manual skills, and lots of patience.\n\nToday typesetting is almost always done digitally, with very powerful tools like Adobe InDesign.\n\nBut CSS has never had any typesetting tools. So getting it right has meant a lot of manual labour – much like in the old times. [This article by Espen Brunborg][1] should give you an idea.\n\nIf you’re interested, there’s some more reading [here](./For the curious.md).\n\n[1]: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/12/17/css-baseline-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/  \"CSS Baseline: The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\"\n\n\n\n\nA CSS *library*?\n----------------\n\n*tidy-type* is not a CSS framework. There are swarms of them out there – and few really tackle the problem of typesetting.\n\n*tidy-type* is different. It’s not a framework – it’s a CSS library. It solves just one complex problem – online typesetting.\n\nIt does one thing and does it well. It integrates well with your stylesheets, and with any existing CSS framework.\n\n\n\n\n*Focused*?\n--------\n\n*tidy-type* is focused on the single problem it solves. In most cases it will set no more than four properties:\n\n* the font size\n* the line height\n* top and bottom padding\n* top and bottom margins\n\nAll the rest is up to you or up to the framework you’re using.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n_Work in progress._\n",
